# 17 Fitness Tracker

The fitness tracker is a no SQL app that uses MongoDB to hold information about a user's workouts. Users can enter resistance and cardio workouts, pick up on their last workout, or view stats on all previous workouts.

## Installation
npm i

## Usage
Once the app is opened, if there are no prior workouts, you will see a button that says "New Workout." Users will click on that button and follow the inputs on how to enter their workout. After each entry, users will click to add an exercise or to complete the workout. On the homescreen, you will see a workout summary. If you click "Dashboard" in the navigation, you will be able to view stats for all workouts.
